Demonstration:

This is a chance to show off some of your development and UX skills.

 Please build an app (either a mobile optimized C# MVC web application or native iOS app) that allows a

user to search iTunes. After searching, display the results and allow a user to click to the corresponding

iTunes page.  You can search iTunes by using the iTunes Search API here:

 https://affiliate.itunes.apple.com/resources/documentation/itunes-store- web-service- search-api/

 Please include a server side component that tracks how many result clicks are made within the app and a

create a view that displays the count of clicks

 When the user clicks on a search result, the app should redirect to the album/video/app in the itunes

store

 If creating an app, the client does not need to be in the app store, but we should be able to install the

client and test on one of our test devices, e.g. by installing the apk directly, through a program like test

flight, etc.
